    <h2>Polytope</h2>

    <p>
      The word "polytope" means the generalization of a polygon or polyhedron in
      multiple dimensions. We can talk about the "cells" of a polytope, which are the
      generalization of sides or faces.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program only looks at regular convex polytopes. That means all of the
      cells and angles are the same. In 3 dimensions, the five regular polytopes are
      called the Platonic Solids.

    <h2>Types</h2>

    <h3>Simplex</h3>
    <p>
      A simplex is the smallest polytope. A line segment, a triangle, and a
      tetrahedron are simlexes. In higher dimension you can make an n-simplex by
      taking an (n-1)-simplex and adding a new vertex above it connecting each of the
      existing vertices to the new one with a new edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a simplex in every dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      See Wikipedia's article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"
                                    target="_blank">Simplex</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>Hypercube</h3>
    <p>
      A hypercube or sometimes called an n-cube is the generalization of a square or
      cube.
      There is a hypercube in every dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      See Wikipedia's article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube"
                                    target="_blank">Hypercube</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>Cross type</h3>
    <p>
      An n dimensional cross type polytope is made by taking an (n-1) dimensional
      cube and adding one point above and one point below the cube. Connect each of
      the cube's vertices to both of the new points. If you start with a square, you
      end up with an octohedron. If you start with a line segment, you end up with a
      square.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a cross type polytope in every dimension.
    </p>
