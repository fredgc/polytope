    <p>
      This program draws regular polytopes in several dimensions. See
      <a href="help.html">the overview</a> for an explanation of what a polytope is.
      See <a href="controls.html">controls</a> for how to use the program.

    <h2>Privacy and Data Retention</h2>

    <p>
      This program allows the user to change settings that are saved on your
      device. This is done via flutter's
      <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences" target="_blank">
      SharedPreferences </a> which are backed by Android Shared Preferences on
      Android and LocalStorage for a web app. For Android, the data will be
      deleted when you uninstall the app. For the web, the data will be deleted
      when you clear application data in your browser.
