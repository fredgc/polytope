    <h2>Controls</h2>

    <p>
      The top bar contains several menus.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first menu lets you pick which type of regular polytope to display.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second menu lets you pick the dimension of the polytope.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next is a check box showing if the slice is visible or not.
      When you check the "slice" checkbox, an intersection of the slice with a hyperplane will be displayed. The slide-bar at the bottom of the screen allows you to control the height of the hyperplane. See <a href="slice.html">slice</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the slice checkbox is the transformation menu. Initially, it is set to
      "Rotate R3". If you have a keyboard, you can also use the shift, control, or
      alt keys to change which transformation is active.
    </p>

    <h3>Rotate R3</h3>
    <p>
      If you drag your mouse or finger, the polytope will rotate in 3 dimensions.
      Use two fingers or the mouse scroll wheel to scale the polytope.
    </p>

    <h3>Rotate R4</h3>
    <p>
      If you drag your mouse or finger, the polytope will rotate in 4 dimensions.
      That means that instead of rotating in the x-z plane and the y-z plane, the
      polytope will rotate in the x-w plane or y-w plane.
    </p>

    <h3>Rotate R5</h3>
    <p>
      If you drag your mouse or finger, the polytope will rotate in 5 dimensions.
    </p>

    <h3>Zolly</h3>
    <p>
      Dragging the mouse or finger will change the perspective
      transformation. I.e. things that are farther away will either a lot smaller or
      just a little smaller.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom" target="_blank">Zolly</a> is
      a contraction of zoom and dolly, and I did not make up that word.
    </p>

    <h3>Translate</h3>
    <p>
      Dragging the mouse or finger will move the polytope.
    </p>

    <h3>Vertex First</h3>
    <p>
      Rotate the polytope so that a vertex is closest to the camera. A new slice
      intersection will hit the vertex first.
    </p>

    <h3>Edge First</h3>
    <p>
      Rotate the polytope so that an edge is closest to the camera. A new slice
      intersection will hit the edge first.
    </p>

    <h3>Face First</h3>
    <p>
      Rotate the polytope so that a face is closest to the camera. A new slice
      intersection will hit the face first.
    </p>

    <h3>3-Cell First</h3>
    <p>
      Rotate the polytope so that a 3-cell is closest to the camera. A new slice
      intersection will hit the 3-cell first.
    </p>

    <h2>Velocity</h2>
    <p>
      If you fling your mouse or finger while rotating in R3, the polytope will
      continue to rotate. Click or tap in the screen to stop it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you fling your mouse or finger while adjusting the slice slidebar, the slice
      height will continue to change. Click or tap on the slider to stop it.
    </p>

    <h2>Settings</h2>

    <p>
      On the settings screen you can change the theme color, as well as the color of
      the polytope and the slice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sticky delay and sticky radius allow the slidebar to pause for a short time
      at important points. An important point is where the hyperplane intersects a
      point, edge, or face at only one height instead of in a range.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "hotkey buttons for touchscreen" adds buttons on a touchscreen that mimic
      the effects of the shift, alt, and control keys.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leave the "Periodic Debug Logs" off. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
