    <h2>Slices</h2>

    <p>
      To help visualize an n-dimensional polytope, this program will display the
      intersection of the polytope with an (n-1)-dimensional hyperplane. The
      intersection will also be a convex polytope, but it might not be regular. When
      the slice is active, there will be a slider at the bottom of the screen that
      controls the height of the hyperplane.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand what is going on, it might help to start with a cube in 3
      dimensions. Click the slice button to create the slice. Move the slider at the
      bottom of the screen back and forth and you will see that the intersection of a
      cube with a plane is a square.</p>

    <p>
      That is, it is a square if the cube has one face parallel to the plane. Click
      on the rotation menu and select "Edge first". Then recreate the slice. Now you
      will see that the intersection starts of as an edge, turns into a rectangle
      that gets fatter until it is a square, and then shrinks back to an edge before
      disappearing.</p>

    <p>
      Now rotate the cube to be "Vertex first" and recreate the slice. This time, the
      intersection will start off as a point and grow into a triangle. When the
      triangle gets as large as it can, it starts to loose its corners. At the middle
      of the cube, the intersection is a hexagon.</p>

    <p>
      Once you feel you understand what you are looking at, try intersecting a 4-cube
      with a 3-dimensional hyperplane.</p>
